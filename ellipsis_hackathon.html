                  <li><strong>Category</strong>: Coding Competition (Hackathon)</li>
                  <li><strong>Competition Details</strong>: <a href>https://ellipsis.sis.smu.edu.sg/tech-series/Hackathon.html</a></li>
                  <li><strong>Project Duration</strong>: Sept 2020</li>

              <strong>Challenge statement:</strong>

                <p>Information is generated at a pace faster than ever before but the signal is often lost amongst the noise. The ability to process large volumes of data quickly and correlate between events in near real time is a crucial competitive advantage in helping you manage your personal finances.</p>

                <p>Leveraging AWSâ€™s cloud platform and product offerings, you will be designing, implementing and delivering a system to help your peers steer their finances to safe harbors.</p>

                <p>In 2016, The Straits Times reported that as many as 2 in 3 young people have not started investing with the lack of financial knowledge being cited as one of the key reasons. As financial information is becoming increasingly accessible and more diverse in nature, it is important that youths have the access to the right information to help facilitate an apt investment plan for retirement.</p>

                <p>Your task is to design a solution on a platform of your choice, mobile or web, that empowers youths to make smart decisions with their finances by recommending ways and means to make their money work for them.</p>

                <p>The solution should target youths with emphasis in helping them make sense of the labyrinth of financial information available out there and how this information can guide them in making smart decisions.</p>
          
              <strong>Personal Reflections:</strong>
              <p>This was the first time I participated in a hackathon and it was a exciting but also nerve-wrecking experience. With a extremely short duration, my team has very little time to ideate and also build the web application.<br>
              Throughout the hackathon, we had many stressful moments when time was not on our side and many bugs needed fixing. However, it was still extremely fun to challenge ourselves and I am extremely proud of my team building something within 2 days that we would have previously done in a semester. </p>
